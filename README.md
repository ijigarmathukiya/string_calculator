# String Calculator (TDD Assessment)

This repository contains the solution to the **String Calculator** task, implemented using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. The task was part of the Software Craftsperson (Node/Typescript) assessment.

## Problem Description

The task was to implement a simple string calculator with the following requirements:

1. **Basic Addition**: Add up to two numbers in a string, separated by commas. If the string is empty, return 0.
2. **Multiple Numbers**: The calculator should handle an unknown number of numbers in the string.
3. **Newline Delimiters**: The calculator should handle newlines as delimiters between numbers.
4. **Custom Delimiters**: The calculator should support custom delimiters that are defined at the start of the string, in the format `//[delimiter]\n`.
5. **Negative Numbers**: The calculator should throw an error when encountering negative numbers.
